When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When there are other contributors to the project who make changes, its ideal
    to use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Same reason as Manual-saving option. It offers flexibility and User can commit,
    after a logical change not mid-way or after too many logical changes that could
    occur in case of Automatic Git pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork helps in cloning a repo already existing on Github.
    Cloning helps in many ways, usually after forking someone's else's repo.
    Branches helps in adding a new feature without the fear of breaking the whole 
    project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of last known remote state enables fast-forward merges.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without GitHub it'd be difficult to send the files physically on a Flashdrive
    or e-mail the zipped version. This creates lot of reduntant copies of the files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Whwenever we need a new feature that we're not confident enough to make mainline.
