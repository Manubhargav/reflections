How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff showed only the lines that were edited helping me easily to 
    spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In the long term, it may help overcome my fear of breaking something in the
    project, having a history helps me to restore the version to the working one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: 	User knows a logical change and can commit when there is one reducing 
    		"commits cluttered with features" & "commits with do not render" 
    		because auto-save saved the file mid-line".

    Cons:	If the user does not have idea about the logical change, or is forgetful
    		Auto-save can be helpful.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    VCS handles files that are code-related, which usually, have multiple files that
    are inter-dependant, thus saving multiple files helps the coder and make a 
    meaningful sense of whole project rather than change in a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps in viewing the history in an overview. It shows the commit messages
    stating the changes made in that commit.
    git diff helps by differentiating between two commits and thus helps in 
    understanding the file history better. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now that I know, I can checkout a previous working version (or do a git diff to 
    check what broke something) I can confidently work around any project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for anything remotely code, even for small projects.
